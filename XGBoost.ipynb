    "#### Gradient Boost\n",
    "Gradient boosting is a method that goes through cycles to iteratively add models into an ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "It begins by initializing the ensemble with a single model, whose predictions can be pretty naive. (Even if its predictions are wildly inaccurate, subsequent additions to the ensemble will address those errors.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we start the cycle:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, we use the current ensemble to generate predictions for each observation in the dataset. To make a prediction, we add the predictions from all models in the ensemble.\n",
    "- These predictions are used to calculate a loss function (like mean squared error, for instance).\n",
    "- Then, we use the loss function to fit a new model that will be added to the ensemble. Specifically, we determine model parameters so that adding this new model to the ensemble will reduce the loss. (Side note: The \"gradient\" in \"gradient boosting\" refers to the fact that we'll use gradient descent on the loss function to determine the parameters in this new model.)\n",
    "- Finally, we add the new model to ensemble, and repeat.\n",

    "- `n_estimators` specifies how many times to go through the modeling cycle described above. It is equal to the number of models that we include in the ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `early_stopping_rounds` offers a way to automatically find the ideal value for n_estimators. Early stopping causes the model to stop iterating when the validation score stops improving, even if we aren't at the hard stop for `n_estimators`. It's smart to set a high value for n_estimators and then use `early_stopping_rounds` to find the optimal time to stop iterating.  \n",
    "  When using early_stopping_rounds, you also need to set aside some data for calculating the validation scores - this is done by setting the eval_set parameter.\n",
