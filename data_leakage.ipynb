    "### Intro\n",
    "Data leakage (or leakage) happens when your training data contains information about the target, but similar data will not be available when the model is used for prediction. This leads to high performance on the training set (and possibly even the validation data), but the model will perform poorly in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, leakage causes a model to look accurate until you start making decisions with the model, and then the model becomes very inaccurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of leakage: target leakage and train-test contamination.\n",
    "\n",
    "### target leakage\n",
    "Target leakage occurs when your predictors include data that will not be available at the time you make predictions. It is important to think about target leakage in terms of the timing or chronological order that data becomes available, not merely whether a feature helps make good predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### train-test contamination\n",
    "A different type of leak occurs when you aren't careful to distinguish training data from validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that validation is meant to be a measure of how the model does on data that it hasn't considered before. You can corrupt this process in subtle ways if the validation data affects the preprocessing behavior. This is sometimes called train-test contamination."
